    current_resistor: 0.001 #The value of the shunt resistor for current measurement. Defaults to the Sonoff POW's value 0.001 ohm. Verified on https://fccid.io/2ANOO-SM800/Internal-Photos/Internal-Photos-3601477 that we use "R001" = 0.001 ohm
    voltage_divider: 4600 #The value of the voltage divider on the board as (R_upstream + R_downstream) / R_downstream. Defaults to the Sonoff POW's value 2351. From the pic we use 2x "125" = 2x 1.2 M ohm for R_upstream and "102" = 1 k ohm for R_downstream, so (1,200,000+1,200,000+1,000)/1,000 = 2401
    # but those don't fix the measurement values, probably because we actually have a BL0937 chip instead of a HLW8012, (and part variance as well) so we have to manually calibrate with a known load or a load and a Kill-A-Watt type meter. My values used below will only be +/-10% of yours I think.
